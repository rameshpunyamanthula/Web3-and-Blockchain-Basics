📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete, hands-on introduction to fundamental Web3 concepts, including blockchain exploration, testnet interaction, wallet configuration, and decentralized application (DApp) usage.
The task includes working with the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet, setting up a MetaMask wallet, analyzing real block and transaction data, and interacting with a live DApp (Uniswap Testnet).

All required screenshots, observations, and a formal reflection are compiled into a single PDF:

🎯 Objectives

The purpose of this task is to:

Understand core blockchain concepts

Learn how decentralized systems differ from Web2

Configure and secure a Web3 wallet (MetaMask)

Explore the Ethereum testnet (Sepolia)

Perform or simulate a DApp interaction

Document learnings and reflections professionally

This assignment forms the foundation for future Web3 development work.

🧩 Task Breakdown
1️⃣ Blockchain & Web3 Fundamentals

The task involved studying core mechanisms such as:

Distributed ledger technology (DLT)

Consensus algorithms (PoW, PoS)

Smart contract execution

Gas fees and transaction lifecycle

Decentralization vs. centralization

These concepts were reinforced through practical exploration of the Sepolia testnet.

2️⃣ MetaMask Wallet Setup

Steps completed:

Installed MetaMask browser extension

Created a wallet and secured private seed (not included in submission)

Switched network from Ethereum Mainnet → Sepolia Testnet

Verified that the wallet initialized correctly

Screenshots of wallet setup and configuration are included in the final PDF.

3️⃣ Exploring the Sepolia Blockchain

Using Etherscan Testnet, the assignment required:

Viewing a real Sepolia block

Analyzing:

Block number

Status

Gas usage

Fee recipient

Timestamp

Number of transactions

Viewing a real Sepolia transaction

Analyzing:

Transaction hash

Sender and recipient

Gas price

Value transferred

Both screenshots and interpretations are included in the PDF.

4️⃣ DApp Interaction (Uniswap Testnet)

The MetaMask wallet was connected to Uniswap running on Sepolia.

Steps completed:

Connected Web3 wallet to the DApp

Selected swap tokens

Attempted swap transaction

Observed MetaMask transaction lifecycle

Documented behavior when insufficient testnet funds were available

Screenshot of the connected DApp UI is included in the PDF.

5️⃣ Reflection (300–500 Words)

A professionally written reflection summarizing:

Differences between blockchain and traditional databases

Smart contract functionality

Wallet security learnings

Gas fee behavior and transaction flow

Overall Web3 experience gained

This reflection is included at the end of the PDF.
